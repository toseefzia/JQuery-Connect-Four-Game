A two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column,  
six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.   
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.   
Connect Four is a solved game.   
The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
